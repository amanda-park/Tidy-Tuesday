# Twitter Report Analysis

I did this analysis back in July 2019. Since then, I've learned more about Natural Language Processing and would probably take a more advanced approach to this analysis. But this does cover the basics of me trying NLP for the first time, and hopefully this is useful to others as well.

A deployed version of this analysis can be found [here](https://amandapark.shinyapps.io/TwitterAnalysis/).
