The **Agreeableness** scale refers to how people tend to treat others in relationships. People's agreeableness ranges from more competitive, straightforward and cold to more unselfish, warm and helpful.

The **Extroversion** scale concerns how sociable and outgoing people are. Those with higher results draw energy from or recharge by interacting with others, while those with lower results get tired when interacting with others.

The **Neuroticism** scale measures confidence, general temperament and being comfortable in one’s own skin. People’s emotional stability ranges from very emotionally sensitive and tense to very confident and sure of themselves.

The **Open-Mindedness** scale concerns people's willingness to try new things and their capability to think outside the box. People's openness ranges from very traditional and conventional to very curious, daring and innovative.
