Analysis was done on patient-no show data from 4/29/2016 to 6/8/2016, with the goal being to fit a model to predict the probability of a patient no-show. Upon fitting a penalized LASSO logistic regression model, a model was built that predicted with 80% accuracy whether or not a patient would no-show. 

Variables Associated With No-Show:
* Location ID (some locations are associated with higher no-show, and some are associated with lower no-show)
* An SMS message being sent to a patient
* Days between schedule date and appointment date 

Recommendations:
* Flag patients that have repeatedly no-showed in the system (more than once) as being high-risk to no-show again. Give them additional focus to ensure they arrive to their appointment (for example, a phone call reminder).
* When feasible, reduce the percentage of high-risk patients requesting appointments very far out. 
* Experiment with the timing of the text messages and when they are sent to patients. Right now over 43% of patients who no-show receive a text message reminder.
