# Tidy-Tuesday

This is a repository I'm setting up to show off some of the #TidyTuesday worthy R code I've done in some projects in the past. Hopefully you find this all useful in some way!

Currently included:
* Scraping web data for Pokedex information using rvest
* Sentiment Analysis on above-mentioned scraped Pokedex data
* A simple Shiny app built on a combination of Pokedex and Pokemon data
* Creating a function for basic EDA purposes on NFL salary data using tidyverse and ggplot2 
* An NLP analysis of my personal Twitter account's tweets
* A logistic regression analysis on Pokemon combat statistics (project from grad school; includes Shiny components in deployed version)
