# Tidy-Tuesday

This is a repository I'm setting up to show off some of the #TidyTuesday worthy code I've done in some projects in the past. Hopefully you find this all useful in some way!

Currently included:
* Scraping web data for Pokedex information using rvest
* Creating a function for basic EDA purposes using tidyverse and ggplot2
* An NLP analysis of my personal Twitter account's tweets
* A logistic regression analysis on Pokemon combat statistics (includes Shiny components in deployed version)
