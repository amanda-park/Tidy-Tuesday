# Tidy-Tuesday

This repository stashes some R #TidyTuesday miscellaneous code I've worked on over the years. Specific Pokemon examples have been moved to a separate repo called Pokemon-Analysis.

## Currently included in this repo:

* Creating a function for basic EDA purposes on NFL salary data using tidyverse and ggplot2 
* A Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis of my personal Twitter account's tweets
* A forecasting template with custom functions to run and test many different popular statistical and machine learning forecasting approaches (using ModelTime)
* A binary classification problem for predicting medical no-shows using the tidymodels framework
* A binary classification analysis using my package easytidymodels on NFLFastR data
