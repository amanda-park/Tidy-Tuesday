"5684","Cherrim","After absorbing plenty of sunlight, Cherrim takes this form. It’s full of energy while it’s like this, and its liveliness will go on until sundown."
"5685","Cherrim","The faint scent that emanates from its full blossom entices bug Pokémon to it."
"5686","Shellos","Its colors and shapes differ from region to region. In the Sinnoh region, two types are confirmed."
"5687","Shellos","It lives along bodies of water. Its body shape has changed to suit its habitat."
"5688","Shellos","Beware of pushing strongly on its squishy body, as it makes a mysterious purple fluid ooze out."
"5689","Shellos","Its shape and coloration vary, depending on its habitat."
"5690","Shellos","Shellos lives in the sea and feasts on plankton. The lovelier the ocean where Shellos resides, the more vibrant its color becomes."
"5691","Shellos","The difference in color from one Shellos to another seems to be a result of their diet. No large changes can be seen in their capabilities."
"5692","Shellos","When it senses danger, it gushes a purple liquid. Some theories suggest this liquid is a greasy sweat induced by stress."
"5693","Shellos","Scientists interested in its great regenerative capabilities are currently analyzing the materials from which its cells are made."
"5694","Shellos","There’s speculation that its appearance is determined by what it eats, but the truth remains elusive."
"5695","Shellos","Its appearance changes depending on the environment. One theory suggests that living in cold seas causes Shellos to take on this form."
"5696","Shellos","For the most part, it makes its home along the seashore. Its color and form differ according to its habitat and the quality of its food."
"5697","Shellos","Purple mucus sticks to the hands of anyone who touches it. Take care, as the substance is troublesome to wash off. "
"5698","Shellos","While they normally live in the sea, they can function on land, too, until their skin dries out."
"5699","Shellos","When it senses danger, a purple liquid oozes out of it. The liquid is thought to be something like greasy sweat."
"5700","Shellos","This Pokémon’s habitat shapes its physique. According to some theories, life in warm ocean waters causes this variation to develop."
"5701","Shellos","Subjecting this Pokémon to a strong force causes it to secrete a strange purple fluid. Though harmless, the fluid is awfully sticky."
"5702","Gastrodon","It has a pliable body without any bones. If any part of its body is torn off, it grows right back."
"5703","Gastrodon","It apparently had a huge shell for protection in ancient times. It lives in shallow tidal pools."
"5704","Gastrodon","Long ago, its entire back was shielded with a sturdy shell. There are traces of it left in its cells."
"5705","Gastrodon","When its natural enemy attacks, it oozes purple fluid and escapes."
"5706","Gastrodon","A team of researchers is scouring the oceans of the world in search of a Gastrodon in a color never seen before."
"5707","Gastrodon","Experiments are being conducted to discover what happens when a Gastrodon is raised in a location other than the sea where it was born."
"5708","Gastrodon","When it’s attacked, it gushes a purple liquid that’s not poisonous but makes Gastrodon’s meat bitter and inedible."
"5709","Gastrodon","A relative of Shellder and Cloyster, this ocean dweller sometimes comes onto land in search of food."
"5710","Gastrodon","It secretes a purple fluid to deter enemies. This fluid isn’t poisonous—instead, it’s super sticky, and once it sticks, it’s very hard to unstick."
"5711","Gastrodon","Its body is covered in a sticky slime. It’s very susceptible to dehydration, so it can’t spend too much time on land."
"5712","Gastrodon","It has strong regenerative capabilities. Even if parts of it are bitten off by fish Pokémon, it will return to normal within a few hours."
"5713","Gastrodon","Plankton, invisible to the naked eye, is its main food source. It comes onto the land periodically, but the reason for this is not known."
"5714","Gastrodon","Long ago, it had a shell on its back. There’s now a vestigial plate on its back that’s hard but thin."
"5715","Gastrodon","Their shape and color change, depending on their environment and diet. There are many of them at beaches where the waves are calm."
"5716","Gastrodon","Its search for food sometimes leads it onto land, where it leaves behind a sticky trail of slime as it passes through."
"5717","Gastrodon","The softness of its body helps disperse the force of impacts, so although its body is uncommonly squishy, it’s also surprisingly resilient."
"5718","Ambipom","To eat, it deftly shucks nuts with its two tails. It rarely uses its arms now."
"5719","Ambipom","They work in large colonies and make rings by linking their tails, apparently in friendship."
"5720","Ambipom","Split into two, the tails are so adept at handling and doing things, AMBIPOM rarely uses its hands."
"5721","Ambipom","They live on large trees. They are said to communicate by connecting their tails to those of others."
"5722","Ambipom","It is very difficult to dodge the consecutive strikes of its two tails."
"5723","Ambipom","Split into two, the tails are so adept at handling and doing things, Ambipom rarely uses its hands."
"5724","Ambipom","In their search for comfortable trees, they get into territorial disputes with groups of Passimian. They win about half the time."
"5725","Ambipom","It uses its tails for everything. If it wraps both of its tails around you and gives you a squeeze, that’s proof it really likes you."
"5726","Drifloon","A Pokémon formed by the spirits of people and Pokémon. It loves damp, humid seasons."
"5727","Drifloon","It tugs on the hands of children to steal them away. However, it gets pulled around instead."
"5728","Drifloon","Because of the way it floats aimlessly, an old folktale calls it a “Signpost for Wandering Spirits.”"
"5729","Drifloon","It is whispered that any child who mistakes DRIFLOON for a balloon and holds on to it could wind up missing."
"5730","Drifloon","These Pokémon are called the “Signpost for Wandering Spirits.” Children holding them sometimes vanish."
"5731","Drifloon","Stories go that it grabs the hands of small children and drags them away to the afterlife. It dislikes heavy children."
"5732","Drifloon","If for some reason its body bursts, its soul spills out with a screaming sound."
"5733","Drifloon","Its round body is stuffed with souls and expands each time it leads someone away."
"5734","Drifloon","Wandering souls gathered together to form this Pokémon. When trying to make friends with children, Drifloon grabs them by the hand."
"5735","Drifloon","Perhaps seeking company, it approaches children. However, it often quickly runs away again when the children play too roughly with it."
"5736","Drifloon","The gathering of many souls gave rise to this Pokémon. During humid seasons, they seem to appear in abundance."
"5737","Drifblim","It’s drowzy in daytime, but flies off in the evening in big groups. No one knows where they go."
"5738","Drifblim","It carries people and Pokémon when it flies. But since it only drifts, it can end up anywhere."
"5739","Drifblim","At dusk, swarms of them are carried aloft on winds. When noticed, they suddenly vanish."
"5740","Drifblim","It can generate and release gas within its body. That’s how it can control the altitude of its drift."
"5741","Drifblim","They carry people and Pokémon, but the wind can catch them, so there can’t be a fixed destination."
"5742","Drifblim","It’s drowsy in daytime, but flies off in the evening in big groups. No one knows where they go."
"5743","Drifblim","There was once an incident in which a man took a trip riding a Drifblim, only to go missing."
"5744","Drifblim","Even while under careful observation, large flocks of Drifblim flying at dusk will inexplicably disappear from view."
"5745","Drifblim","There’s a rumor that if you catch a Drifblim floating on the wind at dusk, you’ll be carried away to the afterlife."
"5746","Drifblim","The raw material for the gas inside its body is souls. When its body starts to deflate, it’s thought to carry away people and Pokémon."
"5747","Drifblim","Some say this Pokémon is a collection of souls burdened with regrets, silently drifting through the dusk."
"5748","Drifblim","It grabs people and Pokémon and carries them off somewhere. Where do they go? Nobody knows."
"5749","Buneary","It slams foes by sharply uncoiling its rolled ears. It stings enough to make a grown-up cry in pain."
"5750","Buneary","When it senses danger, it perks up its ears. On cold nights, it sleeps with its head tucked into its fur."
"5751","Buneary","Its ears are always rolled up. They can be forcefully extended to shatter even a large boulder."
"5752","Buneary","You can tell how it feels by the way it rolls its ears. When it’s scared, both ears are rolled up."
"5753","Buneary","By extending its rolled-up ears and striking the ground, it can bound so high it surprises itself."
"5754","Buneary","Its arms and legs are weak, but when it rolls its ears up tight and then unleashes them with its full force, it can smash boulders to dust."
"5755","Buneary","The reason it keeps one ear rolled up is so it can launch a swift counterattack if it’s attacked by an enemy."
"5756","Buneary","If both of Buneary’s ears are rolled up, something is wrong with its body or mind. It’s a sure sign the Pokémon is in need of care."
"5757","Buneary","Buneary can attack by rolling up their ears and then striking with the force created by unrolling them. This attack becomes stronger with training."
"5758","Lopunny","An extremely cautious Pokémon. It cloaks its body with its fluffy ear fur when it senses danger."
"5759","Lopunny","It is very conscious of its looks and never fails to groom its ears. It runs with sprightly jumps."
"5760","Lopunny","The ears appear to be delicate. If they are touched roughly, it kicks with its graceful legs."
"5761","Lopunny","It sheds its fur twice a year. Its winter fur is soft and fluffy."
"5762","Lopunny","Extremely cautious, it quickly bounds off when it senses danger."
"5763","Lopunny","Lopunny regrows its coat twice a year. Mufflers and hats made from its fur are really warm."
"5764","Lopunny","It’s notably wary and has a dislike of fighting, but at the same time, it can deliver powerful kicks with its lithe legs."
"5765","Lopunny","Lopunny is constantly monitoring its surroundings. If danger approaches, this Pokémon responds with superdestructive kicks."
"5766","Lopunny","Once hot seasons are over, Lopunny’s coat will be replaced with fur that holds a lot of insulating air in preparation for colder weather."
"5767","Lopunny","It swings its ears like whips and strikes its enemies with them. It has an intensely combative disposition."
"5768","Lopunny","Mega Evolution awakens its combative instincts. It has shed any fur that got in the way of its attacks."
"5769","Mismagius","Its cries sound like incantations. Those hearing it are tormented by headaches and hallucinations."
"5770","Mismagius","It chants incantations. While they usually torment targets, some chants bring happiness."
"5771","Mismagius","Its cry sounds like an incantation. It is said the cry may rarely be imbued with happiness-giving power."
"5772","Mismagius","Its cries sound like incantations to torment the foe. It appears where you least expect it."
"5773","Mismagius","It appears as if from nowhere—muttering incantations, placing curses, and giving people terrifying visions."
"5774","Mismagius","Mismagius have been known to cast spells to make people fall in love, so some people search for this Pokémon as if their life depended on it."
"5775","Mismagius","Feared for its wrath and the curses it spreads, this Pokémon will also, on a whim, cast spells that help people."
"5776","Mismagius","Its muttered curses can cause awful headaches or terrifying visions that torment others."
"5777","Honchkrow","Becoming active at night, it is known to swarm with numerous MURKROW in tow."
"5778","Honchkrow","It makes its MURKROW cronies bring it food. It idles its time away, grooming itself in its nest."

"5782","Honchkrow","Becoming active at night, it is known to swarm with numerous Murkrow in tow."
"5783","Honchkrow","A single cry from this nocturnal Pokémon, and more than a hundred of its Murkrow cronies will assemble."
"5784","Honchkrow","If its Murkrow cronies fail to catch food for it, or if it feels they have betrayed it, it will hunt them down wherever they are and punish them."
"5785","Honchkrow","It will absolutely not forgive failure from or betrayal by its goons. It has no choice in this if it wants to maintain the order of the flock."
"5786","Honchkrow","Its goons take care of most of the fighting for it. The only time it dirties its own hands is in delivering a final blow to finish off an opponent."
"5787","Glameow","It claws if displeased and purrs when affectionate. Its fickleness is very popular among some."
"5788","Glameow","With its sharp glare, it puts foes in a mild hypnotic state. It is a very fickle Pokémon."

"5791","Glameow","When it’s happy, Glameow demonstrates beautiful movements of its tail, like a dancing ribbon."
"5792","Purugly","It is a brazen brute that barges its way into another Pokémon’s nest and claims it as its own."
"5793","Purugly","To make itself appear intimidatingly beefy, it tightly cinches its waist with its twin tails."
"5794","Purugly","It binds its body with its tails to make itself look bigger. If it locks eyes, it will glare ceaselessly."
"5795","Purugly","It would claim another Pokémon’s nest as its own if it finds a nest sufficiently comfortable."

"5807","Skuntank","It sprays a stinky fluid from its tail. The fluid smells worse the longer it is allowed to fester."

"5816","Bronzor","They are found in ancient tombs. The patterns on their backs are said to be imbued with mysterious power."
"5817","Bronzor","Ancient people believed that the pattern on Bronzor’s back contained a mysterious power."
"5818","Bronzor","It appears in ancient ruins. The pattern on its body doesn’t come from any culture in the Galar region, so it remains shrouded in mystery."
"5819","Bronzor","Polishing Bronzor to a shine makes its surface reflect the truth, according to common lore. Be that as it may, Bronzor hates being polished."
"5820","Bronzong","One caused a news sensation when it was dug up at a construction site after a 2,000-year sleep."
"5821","Bronzong","It can summon rain clouds. People long ago revered it as the bringer of plentiful harvests."

"5828","Bonsly","It looks as if it is always crying. It is actually adjusting its body’s fluid levels by eliminating excess."
"5829","Bonsly","It prefers arid environments. It leaks water from its eyes to adjust its body’s fluid levels."
"5830","Bonsly","It prefers an arid atmosphere. It leaks water that looks like tears when adjusting its moisture level."
"5831","Bonsly","In order to adjust the level of fluids in its body, it exudes water from its eyes. This makes it appear to be crying."
"5832","Bonsly","It does not deal well with water, so it lives in dry locales. Since its surroundings tend to lack greenery, it stands out noticeably."
"5833","Bonsly","From its eyes, it can expel excess moisture from its body. This liquid is similar in composition to human sweat."
"5834","Bonsly","It discharges moisture from its eyes, making it look like it’s crying—apparently an effective way of getting enemies to let down their guard."
"5835","Bonsly","If its body gets too damp, it will die. So, in a process reminiscent of sweating, its eyes expel moisture."
"5836","Bonsly","It expels both sweat and tears from its eyes. The sweat is a little salty, while the tears have a slight bitterness."

"5843","Mime Jr.","When this gifted mimic surprises an opponent, Mime Jr. feels so happy that it ends up forgetting it was imitating something."
"5844","Mime Jr.","It mimics everyone it sees, but it puts extra effort into copying the graceful dance steps of Mr. Rime as practice."

"5872","Gible","It reacts to anything that moves—flies right at it and bites it. Sometimes it injures itself, but it doesn’t care too much."
"5873","Gible","Its original home is an area much hotter than Alola. If you’re planning to live with one, your heating bill will soar."
"5874","Gible","Gible prefers to stay in narrow holes in the sides of caves heated by geothermal energy. This way, Gible can stay warm even during a blizzard."

"5887","Garchomp","It flies at speeds equal to a jet fighter plane. It never allows its prey to escape."
"5888","Garchomp","It is said that when one runs at high speed, its wings create blades of wind that can fell nearby trees."
"5889","Garchomp","Its body is covered in fine scales that reduce drag, enabling it to fly at high speeds."

"6379","Roggenrola","It was found in a fissure in a layer of exposed rock. The material that makes up its body is dirt from several hundred years ago."
"6380","Roggenrola","It’s as hard as steel, but apparently a long soak in water will cause it to soften a bit."
"6381","Roggenrola","When it detects a noise, it starts to move. The energy core inside it makes this Pokémon slightly warm to the touch."
"6382","Boldore","When it overflows with power, the orange crystal on its body glows. It looks for underground water in caves."
"6383","Boldore","Because its energy was too great to be contained, the energy leaked and formed orange crystals."
"6384","Boldore","When it is healthy, its core sticks out. Always facing the same way, it swiftly moves front to back and left to right."
"6385","Boldore","Its orange crystal is a mass of energy. Just one crystal fragment would provide enough fuel for a hundred dump trucks."
"6386","Boldore","It explores caves in search of underground water. It’s not comfortable around water, so this Pokémon takes great care in lapping it up."
"6387","Boldore","The energy overflowing from its body has turned into orange crystals that are hard enough to smash diamonds."
"6388","Boldore","Its orange crystals are lumps of powerful energy. They’re valuable, so Boldore is sometimes targeted for them."
"6389","Boldore","If you see its orange crystals start to glow, be wary. It’s about to fire off bursts of energy."
"6390","Boldore","It relies on sound in order to monitor what’s in its vicinity. When angered, it will attack without ever changing the direction it’s facing."
"6391","Gigalith","Compressing the energy from its internal core lets it fire off an attack capable of blowing away a mountain."

"6400","Woobat","Its habitat is dark forests and caves. It emits ultrasonic waves from its nose to learn about its surroundings."
"6401","Woobat","Suction from its nostrils enables it to stick to cave walls during sleep. It leaves a heart-shaped mark behind."
"6402","Woobat","The heart-shaped mark left on a body after a Woobat has been attached to it is said to bring good fortune."
"6403","Woobat","While inside a cave, if you look up and see lots of heart-shaped marks lining the walls, it’s evidence that Woobat live there."
"6404","Woobat","It emits ultrasonic waves as it flutters about, searching for its prey—bug Pokémon."
"6405","Swoobat","It emits sound waves of various frequencies from its nose, including some powerful enough to destroy rocks."
"6406","Swoobat","Anyone who comes into contact with the ultrasonic waves emitted by a courting male experiences a positive mood shift."
"6407","Swoobat","It shakes its tail vigorously when it emits ultrasonic waves strong enough to reduce concrete to rubble."
"6408","Swoobat","Emitting powerful sound waves tires it out. Afterward, it won’t be able to fly for a little while."
"6409","Swoobat","The auspicious shape of this Pokémon’s nose apparently led some regions to consider Swoobat a symbol of good luck."
"6410","Drilbur","It can dig through the ground at a speed of 30 mph. It could give a car running aboveground a good race."

"6412","Drilbur","By spinning its body, it can dig straight through the ground at a speed of 30 mph."
"6413","Drilbur","It brings its claws together and whirls around at high speed before rushing toward its prey."

"6416","Excadrill","More than 300 feet below the surface, they build mazelike nests. Their activity can be destructive to subway tunnels."
"6417","Excadrill","Forming a drill with its steel claws and head, it can bore through a steel plate, no matter how thick it is."
"6418","Excadrill","It’s not uncommon for tunnels that appear to have formed naturally to actually be a result of Excadrill’s rampant digging."
"6419","Excadrill","Known as the Drill King, this Pokémon can tunnel through the terrain at speeds of over 90 mph."
"6420","Audino","It touches others with the feelers on its ears, using the sound of their heartbeats to tell how they are feeling."
"6421","Audino","Its auditory sense is astounding. It has a radarlike ability to understand its surroundings through slight sounds."
"6422","Audino","Using the feelers on its ears, it can tell how someone is feeling or when an egg might hatch."
"6423","Audino","Audino’s sense of hearing is superb. Not even a pebble rolling along over a mile away will escape Audino’s ears."
"6424","Audino","This Pokémon has a kind heart. By touching with its feelers, Audino can gauge other creatures’ feelings and physical conditions."

"6432","Gurdurr","With strengthened bodies, they skillfully wield steel beams to take down buildings."
"6433","Gurdurr","It shows off its muscles to Machoke and other Gurdurr. If it fails to measure up to the other Pokémon, it lies low for a little while."
"6434","Gurdurr","Gurdurr excels at demolition—construction is not its forte. In any case, there’s skill in the way this Pokémon wields its metal beam."
"6435","Conkeldurr","It is thought that Conkeldurr taught humans how to make concrete more than 2,000 years ago."
"6436","Conkeldurr","They use concrete pillars as walking canes. They know moves that enable them to swing the pillars freely in battle."
"6437","Conkeldurr","Rather than rely on force, they master moves that utilize the centrifugal force of spinning concrete."
"6438","Conkeldurr","Concrete mixed by Conkeldurr is much more durable than normal concrete, even when the compositions of the two materials are the same."
"6439","Conkeldurr","When going all out, this Pokémon throws aside its concrete pillars and leaps at opponents to pummel them with its fists."
"6440","Tympole","They warn others of danger by vibrating their cheeks to create a high-pitched sound."

"6454","Seismitoad","This Pokémon is popular among the elderly, who say the vibrations of its lumps are great for massages."
"6455","Throh","When it tightens its belt, it becomes stronger. Wild Throh use vines to weave their own belts."
"6456","Throh","When they encounter foes bigger than themselves, they try to throw them. They always travel in packs of five."

"6460","Sawk","The sound of Sawk punching boulders and trees can be heard all the way from the mountains where they train."

"6462","Sawk","Desiring the strongest karate chop, they seclude themselves in mountains and train without sleeping."
"6463","Sawk","If you see a Sawk training in the mountains in its single-minded pursuit of strength, it’s best to quietly pass by."
"6464","Sawk","The karate chops of a Sawk that’s trained itself to the limit can cleave the ocean itself."
"6465","Sewaddle","Leavanny dress it in clothes they made for it when it hatched. It hides its head in its hood while it is sleeping."
"6466","Sewaddle","This Pokémon makes clothes for itself. It chews up leaves and sews them with sticky thread extruded from its mouth."
"6467","Sewaddle","Since this Pokémon makes its own clothes out of leaves, it is a popular mascot for fashion designers."
"6468","Swadloon","Forests where Swadloon live have superb foliage because the nutrients they make from fallen leaves nourish the plant life."

"6489","Cottonee","When attacked, it escapes by shooting cotton from its body. The cotton serves as a decoy to distract the attacker."
"6490","Cottonee","They go wherever the wind takes them. On rainy days, their bodies are heavier, so they take shelter beneath big trees."
"6491","Cottonee","Perhaps because they feel more at ease in a group, they stick to others they find. They end up looking like a cloud."
"6492","Cottonee","When it finds others of its kind, they all stick together. When enough of them have collected, the mass resembles a cumulonimbus cloud."

"6512","Petilil","Some say if you dry the leaves on its head, boil them down, and drink the infusion, your vigor will return, so Petilil is popular with the elderly."
"6513","Petilil","They prefer clean water and soil. When the environment they live in turns bad, the whole bunch will up and move to a new area."

"6530","Basculin","Anglers love the fight this Pokémon puts up on the hook. And there are always more to catch— many people release them into lakes illicitly."
"6531","Basculin","In the past, it often appeared on the dinner table. The meat of red-striped Basculin is on the fatty side, and it’s more popular with the youth."
"6532","Basculin","Even Basculin, which devours everything it can with its huge jaws, is nothing more than food to organisms stronger than itself."
"6533","Basculin","Some people call it “the thug of the lake.” Whether the differences in color are meaningful is not yet known."

"6541","Sandile","Alola, where it’s warm all year round, is a comfortable environment for this Pokémon. Sometimes you’ll even see it outside of deserts."
"6542","Sandile","Sandile’s still not good at hunting, so it mostly eats things that have collapsed in the desert. It’s called “the cleaner of the desert.”"
"6543","Sandile","The desert gets cold at night, so when the sun sets, this Pokémon burrows deep into the sand and sleeps until sunrise."
"6544","Sandile","Sandile is small, but its legs and lower body are powerful. Pushing sand aside as it goes, Sandile moves through the desert as if it’s swimming."

"6676","Garbodor","Consuming garbage makes new kinds of poison gases and liquids inside their bodies."
"6677","Garbodor","Beware the poisonous liquid it shoots from its right arm. If even a little of it gets on you, you’ll experience the effects of the unidentified toxin."

"6679","Garbodor","It locks opponents in place with its left hand, immobilizing them by entirely dousing their bodies with poisonous liquid."

"6704","Minccino","The way it brushes away grime with its tail can be helpful when cleaning. But its focus on spotlessness can make cleaning more of a hassle."

"6943","Shelmet","When it and Karrablast are together, and both receive electrical stimulation, they both evolve."

"7274","Aromatisse","Its scent is so overpowering that, unless a Trainer happens to really enjoy the smell, he or she will have a hard time walking alongside it."
"7275","Aromatisse","The scent that constantly emits from its fur is so powerful that this Pokémon’s companions will eventually lose their sense of smell."
"7276","Aromatisse","The scents Aromatisse can produce range from sweet smells that bolster allies to foul smells that sap an opponent’s will to fight."
"7277","Swirlix","To entangle its opponents in battle, it extrudes white threads as sweet and sticky as cotton candy."
"7278","Swirlix","Because it eats nothing but sweets, its fur is as sticky sweet as cotton candy."
"7279","Swirlix","It eats its own weight in sugar every day. If it doesn’t get enough sugar, it becomes incredibly grumpy."
"7280","Swirlix","The sweet smell of cotton candy perfumes Swirlix’s fluffy fur. This Pokémon spits out sticky string to tangle up its enemies."
"7281","Slurpuff","It can distinguish the faintest of scents. It puts its sensitive sense of smell to use by helping pastry chefs in their work."
"7282","Slurpuff","Its sense of smell is 100 million times better than a human’s, so even the faintest scent tells it about everything in the area. It’s like it can see with its nose!"
"7283","Slurpuff","By taking in a person’s scent, it can sniff out their mental and physical condition. It’s hoped that this skill will have many medical applications."
"7284","Slurpuff","Slurpuff’s fur contains a lot of air, making it soft to the touch and lighter than it looks."
"7285","Inkay","Opponents who stare at the flashing of the light-emitting spots on its body become dazed and lose their will to fight."

"7288","Inkay","When exchanging information with others of its kind, it flashes the light-emitting spots on its body in a complex rhythm."

"7291","Malamar","It wields the most compelling hypnotic powers of any Pokémon, and it forces others to do whatever it wants."
"7292","Malamar","It lures its prey close with hypnotic motions, then wraps its tentacles around it before finishing it off with digestive fluids."
"7293","Malamar","When it comes to strong hypnosis, there’s an endless number of people who utilize Malamar for their nefarious deeds."
"7294","Malamar","It flashes the pattern on its torso to control its prey and draw them in. The edges of its fins are supremely sharp."
"7295","Malamar","Gazing at its luminescent spots will quickly induce a hypnotic state, putting the observer under Malamar’s control."
"7296","Malamar","It’s said that Malamar’s hypnotic powers played a role in certain history-changing events."
"7297","Binacle","Two Binacle live together on one rock. When they fight, one of them will move to a different rock."
"7298","Binacle","They stretch and then contract, yanking their rocks along with them in bold hops. They eat seaweed that washes up on the shoreline."
"7299","Binacle","After two Binacle find a suitably sized rock, they adhere themselves to it and live together. They cooperate to gather food during high tide."
"7300","Binacle","If the two don’t work well together, both their offense and defense fall apart. Without good teamwork, they won’t survive."
"7301","Barbaracle","When they evolve, two Binacle multiply into seven. They fight with the power of seven Binacle."
"7302","Barbaracle","Barbaracle’s legs and hands have minds of their own, and they will move independently. But they usually follow the head’s orders."
"7303","Barbaracle","Seven Binacle come together to form one Barbaracle. The Binacle that serves as the head gives orders to those serving as the limbs."
"7304","Barbaracle","Having an eye on each palm allows it to keep watch in all directions. In a pinch, its limbs start to act on their own to ensure the enemy’s defeat."
"7305","Skrelp","Camouflaged as rotten kelp, they spray liquid poison on prey that approaches unawares and then finish it off."
"7306","Skrelp","It looks just like rotten kelp. It hides from foes while storing up power for its evolution."
"7307","Skrelp","It vanishes into seaweed and remains perfectly still to avoid attacks from large Pokémon. Rotten seaweed is its main food source."
"7308","Skrelp","It’s not good at swimming, so it clings to the seaweed. In the Alola region, it’s often found near Dhelmise."
"7309","Skrelp","It drifts in the ocean, blending in with floating seaweed. When other Pokémon come to feast on the seaweed, Skrelp feasts on them instead."
"7310","Skrelp","Skrelp looks like a piece of rotten seaweed, so it can blend in with seaweed drifting on the ocean and avoid being detected by enemies."
"7311","Dragalge","Their poison is strong enough to eat through the hull of a tanker, and they spit it indiscriminately at anything that enters their territory."
"7312","Dragalge","Tales are told of ships that wander into seas where Dragalge live, never to return."
"7313","Dragalge","This vicious Pokémon sprays a poisonous liquid on opponents that come near. For whatever reason, it gets along really well with Dhelmise."
"7314","Dragalge","It blends in with seaweed to ambush its prey and then takes them down with a poisonous liquid strong enough to melt metal."
"7315","Dragalge","Dragalge uses a poisonous liquid capable of corroding metal to send tankers that enter its territory to the bottom of the sea."
"7316","Dragalge","Dragalge generates dragon energy by sticking the plume on its head out above the ocean’s surface and bathing it in sunlight."
"7317","Clauncher","They knock down flying prey by firing compressed water from their massive claws like shooting a pistol."
"7318","Clauncher","Through controlled explosions of internal gas, it can expel water like a pistol shot. At close distances, it can shatter rock."
"7319","Clauncher","Its claws occasionally fall off, and it keeps a low profile until they grow back. The meat of its claws is so delicious!"
"7320","Clauncher","It moves around by jetting water from its right pincer. It has a poor sense of balance, so it’s terrible at swimming straight."
"7321","Clauncher","Clauncher’s claws can fall off during battle, but they’ll regenerate. The meat inside the claws is popular as a delicacy in Galar."
"7322","Clauncher","By detonating gas that accumulates in its right claw, this Pokémon launches water like a bullet. This is how Clauncher defeats its enemies."
"7323","Clawitzer","Their enormous claws launch cannonballs of water powerful enough to pierce tanker hulls."
"7324","Clawitzer","By expelling water from the nozzle in the back of its claw, it can move at a speed of 60 knots."
"7325","Clawitzer","It compresses the water it has sucked up and then projects it with enough power to punch a hole right through a thick sheet of iron."
"7326","Clawitzer","Its right arm is packed with meat. When its pincer falls off, it’s exported to be used as a cooking ingredient."
"7327","Clawitzer","After using the feelers on its oversized claw to detect the location of prey, Clawitzer launches a cannonball of water at its target."
"7328","Clawitzer","Clawitzer’s right arm is a cannon that launches projectiles made of seawater. Shots from a Clawitzer’s cannon arm can sink a tanker."
"7329","Helioptile","They make their home in deserts. They can generate their energy from basking in the sun, so eating food is not a requirement."
"7330","Helioptile","The frills on either side of its head have cells that generate electricity when exposed to sunlight."
"7331","Helioptile","When spread, the frills on its head act like solar panels, generating the power behind this Pokémon’s electric moves."
"7332","Helioptile","The sun powers this Pokémon’s electricity generation. Interruption of that process stresses Helioptile to the point of weakness."
"7333","Heliolisk","They flare their frills and generate energy. A single Heliolisk can generate sufficient electricity to power a skyscraper."
"7334","Heliolisk","It stimulates its muscles with electricity, boosting the strength in its legs and enabling it to run 100 yards in five seconds."
"7335","Heliolisk","A now-vanished desert culture treasured these Pokémon. Appropriately, when Heliolisk came to the Galar region, treasure came with them."
"7336","Heliolisk","One Heliolisk basking in the sun with its frill outspread is all it would take to produce enough electricity to power a city."
"7337","Tyrunt","This Pokémon was restored from a fossil. If something happens that it doesn’t like, it throws a tantrum and runs wild."
"7338","Tyrunt","Its immense jaws have enough destructive force that it can chew up an automobile. It lived 100 million years ago."
"7339","Tyrunt","Its large jaw has incredible destructive power. Some theories suggest that its restored form is different from its form of long ago."
"7340","Tyrunt","Tyrunt is spoiled and selfish. It may just be trying to frolic, but sometimes the ones it’s trying to frolic with are gravely injured."
"7341","Tyrunt","This is an ancient Pokémon, revived in modern times. It has a violent disposition, and it’ll tear apart anything it gets between its hefty jaws."
"7342","Tyrunt","This Pokémon is selfish and likes to be pampered. It can also inflict grievous wounds on its Trainer just by playing around."
"7343","Tyrantrum","Thanks to its gargantuan jaws, which could shred thick metal plates as if they were paper, it was invincible in the ancient world it once inhabited."
"7344","Tyrantrum","Nothing could stop this Pokémon 100 million years ago, so it behaved like a king."
"7345","Tyrantrum","Complete restoration is impossible, allowing room for theories that its entire body was once covered in a feather-like coat."
"7346","Tyrantrum","The king of the ancient world, it can easily crunch a car with the devastating strength of its enormous jaws."
"7347","Tyrantrum","This Pokémon is from about 100,000,000 years ago. It has the presence of a king, vicious but magnificent."
"7348","Tyrantrum","A single bite of Tyrantrum’s massive jaws will demolish a car. This Pokémon was the king of the ancient world."

"7352","Amaura","Amaura was restored successfully, but it’s not expected to live long because of the heat of the current environment."
"7353","Amaura","This Pokémon was successfully restored from a fossil. In the past, it lived with others of its kind in cold lands where there were fewer predators."

"7355","Aurorus","The diamond-shaped crystals on its body expel air as cold as -240 degrees Fahrenheit, surrounding its enemies and encasing them in ice."
"7356","Aurorus","Using its diamond-shaped crystals, it can instantly create a wall of ice to block an opponent’s attack."
"7357","Aurorus","An Aurorus was found frozen solid within a glacier, just as it appeared long ago, which became quite a big event in the news."
"7358","Aurorus","This usually quiet and kindly Pokémon has a surface temperature of around –240 degrees Fahrenheit."

"7361","Sylveon","It sends a soothing aura from its ribbonlike feelers to calm fights."
"7362","Sylveon","It wraps its ribbonlike feelers around the arm of its beloved Trainer and walks with him or her."
"7363","Sylveon","Its ribbonlike feelers give off an aura that weakens hostility in its prey, causing them to let down their guard. Then it attacks."
"7364","Sylveon","When this Pokémon sights its prey, it swirls its ribbonlike feelers as a distraction. A moment later, it pounces."
"7365","Sylveon","Once a fight breaks out, it will unflinchingly charge at dragon Pokémon that are many times larger than itself."

"7373","Hawlucha","It drives its opponents to exhaustion with its agile maneuvers, then ends the fight with a flashy finishing move."
"7374","Hawlucha","It always strikes a pose before going for its finishing move. Sometimes opponents take advantage of that time to counterattack."
"7375","Dedenne","Its whiskers serve as antennas. By sending and receiving electrical waves, it can communicate with others over vast distances."
"7376","Dedenne","It uses its tail to absorb electricity from power plants or from outlets in houses, and then it fires the electricity from its whiskers."
"7377","Dedenne","It sneaks into people’s homes and steals electricity from their outlets. When your electric bill seems off, it’s the handiwork of this rascal."
"7378","Dedenne","Its upper whiskers are sensors that survey its surroundings. Its lower whiskers are organs that shoot electricity."
"7379","Dedenne","A Dedenne’s whiskers pick up electrical waves other Dedenne send out. These Pokémon share locations of food or electricity with one another."
"7380","Dedenne","Since Dedenne can’t generate much electricity on its own, it steals electricity from outlets or other electric Pokémon."

"7382","Carbink","It has slept underground for hundreds of millions of years since its birth. It’s occasionally found during the excavation of caves."

"7388","Carbink","It’s said that somewhere in the world, there’s a mineral vein housing a large pack of slumbering Carbink. It’s also said that this pack has a queen."
"7389","Goomy","The weakest Dragon-type Pokémon, it lives in damp, shady places, so its body doesn’t dry out."
"7390","Goomy","It’s covered in a slimy membrane that makes any punches or kicks slide off it harmlessly."
"7391","Goomy","The weakest of all Dragon-type Pokémon, it’s unable to breathe if its skin dries out, so it sticks to shady places."
"7392","Goomy","Its source of protection is its slimy, germ-laden mucous membrane. Anyone who touches it needs some thorough hand-washing."
"7393","Goomy","It uses its horns to check out its surroundings. They’re very sensitive, so if you grab them, it will feel a strong shock and be unable to move."
"7394","Goomy","Its body is mostly water. If it dries out, it will die, so it’s always sitting with perfect stillness in the shade."
"7395","Goomy","Because most of its body is water, it will dry up if the weather becomes too arid. It’s considered the weakest dragon Pokémon."
"7396","Goomy","Their horns are powerful sensors. As soon as Goomy pick up any sign of enemies, they go into hiding. This is how they’ve survived."
"7397","Sliggoo","It drives away opponents by excreting a sticky liquid that can dissolve anything. Its eyes devolved, so it can’t see anything."

"7403","Sliggoo","Although this Pokémon isn’t very strong, its body is coated in a caustic slime that can melt through anything, so predators steer clear of it."
"7404","Sliggoo","The lump on its back contains its tiny brain. It thinks only of food and escaping its enemies."
"7405","Goodra","This very friendly Dragon-type Pokémon will hug its beloved Trainer, leaving that Trainer covered in sticky slime."

"7410","Goodra","Underneath its slimy skin is a thick layer of fat, and the combination of the two makes enemies’ attacks slide right off."
"7411","Goodra","Sometimes it misunderstands instructions and appears dazed or bewildered. Many Trainers don’t mind, finding this behavior to be adorable."

"7413","Klefki","These key collectors threaten any attackers by fiercely jingling their keys at them."
"7414","Klefki","It never lets go of a key that it likes, so people give it the keys to vaults and safes as a way to prevent crime."
"7415","Klefki","This even-tempered Pokémon has a habit of collecting keys. It will sneak into people’s homes to steal their keys."
"7416","Klefki","It inserts its horn into chinks in metal, absorbing metal ions. For some reason, it collects keys."
"7417","Klefki","Although it’s unclear why it collects keys, giving it a key makes Klefki very happy. However, it apparently only likes master keys."
"7418","Klefki","Long ago it lived in mines, but once the minerals that make up its diet became scarcer, Klefki began appearing in human settlements."
"7419","Klefki","This Pokémon is constantly collecting keys. Entrust a Klefki with important keys, and the Pokémon will protect them no matter what."

"7546","Brionne","It cares deeply for its companions. When its Trainer is feeling down, it performs a cheery dance to try and help."

"7576","Gumshoos","Patient by nature, this Pokémon loses control of itself and pounces when it spots its favorite meal—Rattata!"
"7577","Grubbin","Its strong jaw enables it to scrape trees and slurp out the sap. It normally lives underground."
"7578","Grubbin","They often gather near places frequented by electric Pokémon in order to avoid being attacked by bird Pokémon."
"7579","Grubbin","If you find its nest, you shouldn’t stick your hand inside. You’ll get bitten by an irritated Grubbin."
"7580","Grubbin","It spits a sticky thread to stop opponents in their tracks, and then it grabs them in its sharp, sturdy mandibles to take them down."
"7581","Grubbin","Its natural enemies, like Rookidee, may flee rather than risk getting caught in its large mandibles that can snap thick tree branches."
"7582","Grubbin","It uses its big jaws to dig nests into the forest floor, and it loves to feed on sweet tree sap."

"7587","Charjabug","While its durable shell protects it from attacks, Charjabug strikes at enemies with jolts of electricity discharged from the tips of its jaws."
"7588","Charjabug","Its digestive processes convert the leaves it eats into electricity. An electric sac in its belly stores the electricity for later use."

"7596","Crabrawler","It punches so much, its pincers often come off from overuse, but they grow back quickly. What little meat they contain is rich and delicious."
"7597","Crabrawler","Its hard pincers are well suited to both offense and defense. Fights between two Crabrawler are like boxing matches."

"7620","Cutiefly","Myriads of Cutiefly flutter above the heads of people who have auras resembling those of flowers."
"7621","Cutiefly","Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. In fields of flowers, it gets into skirmishes with Butterfree over food."

"7626","Ribombee","Some of Ribombee’s pollen puffs are highly nutritious. They are sometimes sold as supplements."

"7650","Lycanroc","This strange form is the result of its evolving at dusk. It’s very rare in Alola."

"7652","Lycanroc","These Pokémon have both calm and ferocious qualities. Their temperamental nature makes them a difficult species to raise."
"7653","Wishiwashi","When it’s in trouble, its eyes moisten and begin to shine. The shining light attracts its comrades, and they stand together against their enemies."
"7654","Wishiwashi","It’s awfully weak and notably tasty, so everyone is always out to get it. As it happens, anyone trying to bully it receives a painful lesson."
"7655","Wishiwashi","They’re weak, so they move in schools. However, they can also often be seen all alone, having strayed from the school."
"7656","Wishiwashi","When it’s in a jam, its shining eyes attract others of its kind. The light from its eyes is visible almost 25 miles away."
"7657","Wishiwashi","Individually, they’re incredibly weak. It’s by gathering up into schools that they’re able to confront opponents."
"7658","Wishiwashi","When it senses danger, its eyes tear up. The sparkle of its tears signals other Wishiwashi to gather."
"7659","Wishiwashi","Weak Wishiwashi school together to concentrate their power. Their united force makes them the demon of the sea, feared near and far."
"7660","Wishiwashi","At their appearance, even Gyarados will flee. When they team up to use Water Gun, its power exceeds that of Hydro Pump."
"7661","Wishiwashi","Wishiwashi assemble in this formation to face off against strong foes. It boasts a strength that earned it the name “demon of the sea.”"
"7662","Wishiwashi","Called “demon of the sea” by some, when Wishiwashi are injured in battle and their numbers dwindle, they become a regular school."
"7663","Wishiwashi","On their own, they’re very weak. But when Wishiwashi pool their power together in a school, they become a demon of the sea."
"7664","Wishiwashi","When facing tough opponents, they get into formation. But if they get wounded in battle, they’ll scatter and become solitary again."
"7665","Mareanie","It plunges the poison spike on its head into its prey. When the prey has weakened, Mareanie deals the finishing blow with its 10 tentacles."
"7666","Mareanie","It’s found crawling on beaches and seafloors. The coral that grows on Corsola’s head is as good as a five-star banquet to this Pokémon."
"7667","Mareanie","They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are hated by craftsmen who work with Corsola branches that have naturally fallen off."
"7668","Mareanie","Aside from its head, its body parts regenerate quickly if they’re cut off. After a good night’s sleep, Mareanie is back to normal."
"7669","Mareanie","The first symptom of its sting is numbness. The next is an itching sensation so intense that it’s impossible to resist the urge to claw at your skin."
"7670","Mareanie","Unlike their Alolan counterparts, the Mareanie of the Galar region have not yet figured out that the branches of Corsola are delicious."
"7671","Toxapex","Toxapex crawls along the ocean floor on its 12 legs. It leaves a trail of Corsola bits scattered in its wake."
"7672","Toxapex","Those attacked by Toxapex’s poison will suffer intense pain for three days and three nights. Post-recovery, there will be some aftereffects."
"7673","Toxapex","To attack, this Pokémon sends toxic spikes flying at its enemies. Ones that come close get mown down by the claws on its feet."
"7674","Toxapex","With its 12 legs, it creates a dome to shelter within. The flow of the tides doesn’t affect Toxapex in there, so it’s very comfortable."
"7675","Toxapex","To survive in the cold waters of Galar, this Pokémon forms a dome with its legs, enclosing its body so it can capture its own body heat."
"7676","Toxapex","Within the poison sac in its body is a poison so toxic that Pokémon as large as Wailord will still be suffering three days after it first takes effect."
"7677","Mudbray","The mud stuck to Mudbray’s hooves enhances its grip and its powerful running gait."
"7678","Mudbray","It has a stubborn, individualistic disposition. Eating dirt, making mud, and playing in the mire all form part of its daily routine."
"7679","Mudbray","It loves playing in the mud. If it isn’t showered with mud on a daily basis, it gets stressed out and stops listening to its Trainer."
"7680","Mudbray","Possessing mighty power, Mudbray can be loaded with 50 times its own body weight and will be totally fine."
"7681","Mudbray","Loads weighing up to 50 times as much as its own body weight pose no issue for this Pokémon. It’s skilled at making use of mud."
"7682","Mudbray","It eats dirt to create mud and smears this mud all over its feet, giving them the grip needed to walk on rough terrain without slipping."
"7683","Mudsdale","It spits a mud that provides resistance to both wind and rain, so the walls of old houses were often coated with it."
"7684","Mudsdale","Its heavy, mud-covered kicks are its best means of attack, and it can reduce large trucks to scrap without breaking a sweat."
"7685","Mudsdale","It remains calm and unmoving no matter the situation. It mixes dirt with the saliva in its mouth to make a special kind of mud."
"7686","Mudsdale","It can trudge mountain roads without rest for three days and three nights, all the while dragging a 10-ton load."
"7687","Mudsdale","Mud that hardens around a Mudsdale’s legs sets harder than stone. It’s so hard that it allows this Pokémon to scrap a truck with a single kick."
"7688","Mudsdale","Mudsdale has so much stamina that it could carry over 10 tons across the Galar region without rest or sleep."
"7689","Dewpider","It crawls onto the land in search of food. Its water bubble allows it to breathe and protects its soft head."
"7690","Dewpider","When it comes across enemies or potential prey, this Pokémon smashes its water-bubble-covered head into them."
"7691","Dewpider","When two Dewpider meet, they display their water bubbles to each other. Then the one with the smaller bubble gets out of the other’s way."
"7692","Dewpider","It can only breathe oxygen that has dissolved in water, so it wears a water bubble on its head when it walks around on land."
"7693","Dewpider","It forms a water bubble at the rear of its body and then covers its head with it. Meeting another Dewpider means comparing water-bubble sizes."
"7694","Dewpider","Dewpider normally lives underwater. When it comes onto land in search of food, it takes water with it in the form of a bubble on its head."
"7695","Araquanid","It delivers headbutts with the water bubble on its head. Small Pokémon get sucked into the bubble, where they drown."
"7696","Araquanid","Despite what its appearance suggests, it cares for others. If it finds vulnerable, weak Pokémon, it protectively brings them into its water bubble."
"7697","Araquanid","It usually passes its time in the water. When its belly is full, it stores its subdued prey in the water bubble on its head."
"7698","Araquanid","It has a habit of storing things it values in its water bubble. If its Trainer doesn’t watch out, Araquanid will try to put them in its bubble!"
"7699","Araquanid","It launches water bubbles with its legs, drowning prey within the bubbles. This Pokémon can then take its time to savor its meal."

"8136","Clobbopus","Its tentacles tear off easily, but it isn’t alarmed when that happens—it knows they’ll grow back. It’s about as smart as a three-year-old."
"8137","Grapploct","A body made up of nothing but muscle makes the grappling moves this Pokémon performs with its tentacles tremendously powerful."
"8138","Grapploct","Searching for an opponent to test its skills against, it emerges onto land. Once the battle is over, it returns to the sea."

"8144","Polteageist","When angered, it launches tea from its body at the offender’s mouth. The tea causes strong chills if swallowed."
"8145","Polteageist","This species lives in antique teapots. Most pots are forgeries, but on rare occasions, an authentic work is found."
"8146","Polteageist","Leaving leftover black tea unattended is asking for this Pokémon to come along and pour itself into it, turning the tea into a new Polteageist."
"8147","Hatenna","Via the protrusion on its head, it senses other creatures’ emotions. If you don’t have a calm disposition, it will never warm up to you."

"8149","Hattrem","No matter who you are, if you bring strong emotions near this Pokémon, it will silence you violently."

"8157","Morgrem","When it gets down on all fours as if to beg for forgiveness, it’s trying to lure opponents in so that it can stab them with its spear-like hair."
"8158","Morgrem","With sly cunning, it tries to lure people into the woods. Some believe it to have the power to make crops grow."
"8159","Grimmsnarl","With the hair wrapped around its body helping to enhance its muscles, this Pokémon can overwhelm even Machamp."

"8170","Sirfetch'd","After deflecting attacks with its hard leaf shield, it strikes back with its sharp leek stalk. The leek stalk is both weapon and food."
"8171","Mr. Rime","It’s highly skilled at tap-dancing. It waves its cane of ice in time with its graceful movements."
"8172","Mr. Rime","Its amusing movements make it very popular. It releases its psychic power from the pattern on its belly."

"8176","Milcery","They say that any patisserie visited by Milcery is guaranteed success and good fortune."

"8178","Alcremie","The cells that compose its cream fluctuated suddenly during evolution, giving the cream a bitter flavor."

"8231","Arctovish","Though it’s able to capture prey by freezing its surroundings, it has trouble eating the prey afterward because its mouth is on top of its head."
"8232","Arctovish","The skin on its face is impervious to attack, but breathing difficulties made this Pokémon go extinct anyway."

"8253","Eternatus","As a result of Rose’s meddling, Eternatus absorbed all the energy in the Galar region. It’s now in a state of power overload."
"8254","Eternatus","Infinite amounts of energy pour from this Pokémon’s enlarged core, warping the surrounding space-time."
"8255","Kubfu","Kubfu trains hard to perfect its moves. The moves it masters will determine which form it takes when it evolves."

"8266","Zarude","Once the vines on Zarude’s body tear off, they become nutrients in the soil. This helps the plants of the forest grow."
"8267","Zarude","This Zarude left its pack to raise a human child. The cloth Zarude would wrap the child with has a comforting scent that calmed the child’s crying."
